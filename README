fastqcheck is a program that reads fastq files (sequencing data:
http://maq.sourceforge.net/fastq.shtml).

It generates statistics about the files (for example, how many reads and bases
there were).

It can be used as a validator of fastq files (though is perhaps stricter that
the spec).


Usage:
$ fastqcheck lane1.fastq > lane1.fastq.fastqcheck
$ gunzip -c lane1.fastq.gz | fastqcheck > lan1.fastq.gz.fastqcheck


Compilation:
gcc -std=c99 readseq.c fastqcheck.c -o fastqcheck -lm

Then simply include the resulting fastqcheck executable in your $PATH.
